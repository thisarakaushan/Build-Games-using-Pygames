# Build the Pygames

[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) is a python wrapper for SDLâ€“ a cross-platform C library for controlling multimedia, written by Pete Shinners.It is a wrapper around the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library. What this means is that, using pygame, you can write games or other multimedia applications in Python that will run unaltered on any of SDL's supported platforms (Windows, Unix, Mac, BeOS and others).
